# VSpace

## Problem Statement

- Building a house is expensive these days. As we are moving in fast paced world we don’t have enough time to take care of all things while we are buying or constructing house. 
- Customer may don’t have awareness of new architecture and interior design that are available in market
- Customer want to have better quality at low budget and space

## Solution

Vspace enables the user to get real time experience of how your house should look in small space and budget

##Technologies used

1. React Native 
2. Figma - Design
3. Locofy - Build code

##Workflow

- User register himself and gets verified
- User has to finish 3 steps
    - Select category
    - Select Budget
    - Select space
- List of products will appear and customer can choose best theme of his choice
- Customer experience the architecture in real time by wearing vr lens
- Purchases the product
- VSpace team will launch the selected theme for the customer

## Experience of using Locofy

- Precise design produces clean code
- Spending more time on design will be helpful
- Tagging of elements is very important to produce correct elements in the UI
- Everything works based on auto layout including the screen name
- Prototype does not play any role to build code in locofy
- Frame names plays major role for cleaner code
- After completing all the tagging and assigning actions generating code is simple and faster

## Problems I have faced with locofy

- Auto rotation of frames is nightmare to generate desired preview
- Limitation of hover effects for the elements in react native framework
- Auto tagging images is giving trouble
- Figma componentization is not helpful
- Unable to see complete project structure in code editor of locofy

I am so overwhelmed to join this challenge and my journey so beautiful that I constantly learned so many things in figma and locofy. Locofy hackathon channel was really helpful and resolved issues very quickly. Thank you, spread some love and vote for me guys :)
